# VERIFIED Compatible Requirements for Eye-Controlled Interface
# Updated February 2025 - RESEARCH VERIFIED from PyPI, GitHub, and Google AI docs

# VERIFIED FACT: MediaPipe 0.10.21 (Feb 6, 2025) REQUIRES NumPy < 2.0
# Source: PyPI package info, GitHub issues #5612 & #5676
# Constraint added in v0.10.15 due to "packet propagation issues with numpy 2.0"
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0

# OpenCV - Latest version (supports NumPy 2.0 but we use 1.x for MediaPipe compatibility)
# Verified: OpenCV 4.8+ supports both NumPy 1.x and 2.x
opencv-python>=4.8.0

# MediaPipe - Latest version (0.10.21 released Feb 6, 2025)
# Verified: Supports Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 but REQUIRES NumPy < 2.0
# Status: NumPy 2.0 support timeline unknown
mediapipe==0.10.21

# System control and automation - Latest stable versions
pyautogui>=0.9.54
pynput>=1.7.6

# Image processing and utilities - Latest versions
Pillow>=10.0.0
screeninfo>=0.8.1

# System monitoring and performance - Latest versions
psutil>=5.9.0

# Optional: Additional useful packages for development
matplotlib>=3.7.0
scipy>=1.10.0

# IMPORTANT NOTES (February 2025):
# 1. MediaPipe 0.10.21 is the latest version (released Feb 6, 2025)
# 2. MediaPipe STILL requires NumPy < 2.0 (this constraint was added in v0.10.15)
# 3. OpenCV supports NumPy 2.0 but we must use NumPy 1.x for MediaPipe compatibility
# 4. Python 3.10 is recommended for best compatibility
# 5. Use virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages
