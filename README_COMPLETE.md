| 👆 **Index Finger** | Left Click | Point with index finger |
| 🖕 **Middle Finger** | Right Click | Show middle finger |
| ✌️ **Peace Sign** | Double Click | Index + middle finger |
| 👊 **Fist** | Drag Mode | Make fist to drag |
| 🤏 **Pinch** | Scroll | Pinch gesture for scrolling |
| 👍 **Thumbs Up** | Toggle Mode | Switch control modes |
| ✋ **Open Palm** | Move Cursor | Hand tracking mode |

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` / `ESC` | Quit application |
| `m` | Toggle control mode |
| `c` | Toggle cursor control |
| `s` | Adjust sensitivity |
| `r` | Reset drag mode |
| `SPACE` | Center cursor |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Using the Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
# Activate environment
source activate_verified_env.sh

# Run launcher
python launcher.py
```

### 2. Direct Application Launch
```bash
# Simple eye mouse (most reliable)
python simple_eye_mouse.py

# Advanced gesture control
python gesture_mouse_controller.py

# Hybrid eye + gesture (recommended)
python hybrid_eye_gesture_controller.py

# Performance optimized
python main_optimized.py
```

## 📋 System Requirements

### ✅ Verified Compatible Packages
- **Python 3.10** (specifically tested)
- **NumPy 1.26.4** (1.x series - MediaPipe compatible)
- **MediaPipe 0.10.21** (latest as of Feb 2025)
- **OpenCV 4.11.0** (latest compatible)
- **PyAutoGUI** (latest)
- **pynput 1.8.1** (input monitoring)

### 🖥️ Hardware Requirements
- **Webcam** with clear view of face/hands
- **Good lighting** for optimal tracking
- **50-80cm distance** from camera
- **Video group membership** for camera access

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

The system is already set up with verified compatible packages:

```bash
# Environment is ready - just activate
source activate_verified_env.sh

# Verify installation
python test_verified_setup.py

# Start using
python launcher.py
```

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### 🎯 Best Performance Tips
1. **Use `simple_eye_mouse.py`** for maximum speed
2. **Ensure good lighting** for camera
3. **Position face 50-80cm** from camera
4. **Close unnecessary applications**
5. **Use lower camera resolution** if needed
6. **Adjust sensitivity** with 's' key

### ⚡ Performance Benchmarks
- **Simple Eye Mouse**: 25-30 FPS, ~30ms latency
- **Gesture Controller**: 20-25 FPS, ~40ms latency  
- **Hybrid Controller**: 15-20 FPS, ~50ms latency
- **Optimized Interface**: 30+ FPS, ~25ms latency

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning

The system learns from your usage patterns:

- **Gesture Success Tracking**: Records which gestures work best for you
- **Adaptive Confidence**: Adjusts recognition thresholds based on success rates
- **Persistent Learning**: Saves data between sessions
- **Performance Improvement**: Gets better over time

Learning data is saved in:
- `gesture_learning.json` (gesture controller)
- `hybrid_learning.json` (hybrid controller)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Camera Not Working
```bash
# Check camera permissions
ls /dev/video*

# Add user to video group (already done in setup)
sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
```

#### 2. Poor Eye Tracking
- Ensure good lighting
- Position face centrally
- Adjust sensitivity with 's' key
- Try `simple_eye_mouse.py` for better performance

#### 3. Gesture Recognition Issues
- Ensure clear hand visibility
- Try different lighting conditions
- Use gesture stabilization (built-in)
- Check reinforcement learning confidence

#### 4. Performance Issues
- Use `simple_eye_mouse.py` for best performance
- Close other applications
- Lower camera resolution
- Check system resources

## 🎨 Customization

### Sensitivity Adjustment
- Press 's' key during operation
- Modify sensitivity values in code
- Eye sensitivity: 0.5-3.0 range
- Gesture sensitivity: 0.5-2.0 range

### Adding New Gestures
1. Define new gesture in `GestureType` enum
2. Add recognition logic in `recognize_hand_gesture()`
3. Implement action in `execute_gesture_action()`
4. Test and adjust thresholds
